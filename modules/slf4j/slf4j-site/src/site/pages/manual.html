    <h2>SLF4J user manual</h2>
    
    <p>The Simple Logging Facade for Java or (SLF4J) serves as a
    simple facade or abstraction for various logging frameworks, e.g.
    java.util.logging, log4j and logbback, allowing the end-user to
    plug in the desired logging framework at <em>deployment</em> time.
    </p>
      
    <h3>
    <a name="hello_world" href="#hello_world">Hello World</a>
    </h3>

      <p>It is traditional to present the simplest possible way to
output the text "Hello World". In order to do so with SLF4J you need to
<a href="download.html">download the slf4j distribution</a>, unpack it,
and add these two jar files to your classpath:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>slf4j-api-${project.version}.jar</li>
	<li>slf4j-simple-${project.version}.jar</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The HelloWorld.java file asks for a logger for HelloWorld.class, which in turn logs "Hello World".
      </p>

<pre class="source">
public class HelloWorld {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    org.slf4j.LoggerFactory.getLogger(HelloWorld.class).info("Hello World");
  }
}
</pre>

      HelloWorld will output, when compiled and run:

<pre class="output">0 [main] INFO HelloWorld - Hello World</pre>

      
    <h3>
    <a name="typical_usage" href="#typical_usage">Typical usage
    pattern</a>
    </h3>
 
      <pre class="source">
 1: <b>import org.slf4j.Logger;</b>
 2: <b>import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;</b>
 3: 
 4: public class Wombat {
 5:  
 6:   <b>static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Wombat.class);</b>
 7:   Integer t;
 8:   Integer oldT;
 9:
10:   public void setTemperature(Integer temperature) {
11:    
12:     oldT = t;        
13:     t = temperature;
14:
15:     <b>logger.debug("Temperature set to {}. Old temperature was {}.", t, oldT);</b>
16:
17:     if(temperature.intValue() > 50) {
18:       <b>logger.info("Temperature has risen above 50 degrees.");</b>
19:     }
20:   }
21: }
      </pre>
      
      <p>The example above illustrates the typical usage pattern for
      SLF4j. Note the use of {}-placeholders on line 15. See
      the question <a href="faq.html#logging_performance">"What is the fastest way of
      logging?"</a> in the FAQ for more details.
      </p>
      
      <h3><a name="swapping" href="#binding">Binding with a logging
      framework at deployment time</a></h3>

      <p>SLF4J supports multiple logging frameworks:</p>

      <dl>
	<dt><a href="http://www.slf4j.org/api/org/slf4j/helpers/NOPLogger.html">NOP</a> - <em>slf4j-nop-${project.version}.jar</em></dt>
	<dd>All logging is silently discarded<p/></dd>
	<dt><a href="http://www.slf4j.org/apidocs/org/slf4j/impl/SimpleLogger.html">Simple</a> - <em>slf4j-simple-${project.version}.jar</em></dt>
	<dd>Very small and simple, outputs all events at WARN level or higher to System.err.  Good for small applications.<p/></dd>
	<dt><a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/index.html">log4j version 1.2</a> - <em>slf4j-log4j12-${project.version}.jar</em></dt>
	<dd>A very widely used logging framework.<p/></dd>
	<dt>java.util.logging - <em>slf4j-jdk14-${project.version}.jar</em></dt>
	<dd>Also referred to as JDK 1.4 logging (<a href="http://www.exampledepot.com/egs/java.util.logging/pkg.html">examples</a>)<p/></dd>
        <dt><a href="http://commons.apache.org/logging/">Jakarta Commons Logging</a> - <em>slf4j-jcl-${project.version}.jar</em></dt>
	<dd>A logging layer intended to solve the same problem as slf4j, but at runtime.  Traditionally delegates to log4j or java.util.logging.
	  Currently at version 1.1.  Version 1.0 had problems in discovering the right framework (see the <a
      href="http://www.qos.ch/logging/classloader.jsp">thorough analysis</a>).  <p/></dd>
	<dt><a href="http://logback.qos.ch/"/>logback</a></dt>
	<dd>A fork of log4j by the original author which is under active development.  Supports slf4j natively.<p/></dd>
      </dl>

      <p>Each framework has an indication of which file in the SLF4J distribution
      that should be added to the classpath at deployment to let the required
      <em>slf4j-api-${project.version}.jar</em> bind to that logging
      framework.  The figure below illustrates the general idea.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><a href="images/bindings.png">
      <img border="1" src="images/bindings.png" alt="click to enlarge" width="500"/>
      </a></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>SLF4J does not rely on any special class loader machinery. In
      fact, the each SLF4J binding is hardwired <em>at compile
      time</em> to use one and only one specific logging framework.
      For example, the slf4j-log12-${project.version}.jar binding is bound at compile
      time to use log4j.  In your code, in addition to
      <em>slf4j-api-${project.version}.jar</em>, you simply drop <b>one and only one</b>
      binding of your choice onto the appropriate class path
      location. Please do not place more than one binding on your
      class path because SLF4J can bind with one and only one logging
      framework at a time.
      </p>

      <p>The SLF4J interfaces and their various adapters are extremely
      simple. Most developers familiar with the Java language should
      be able to read and fully understand the code in less than one
      hour.  Hopefully, the simplicity of the SLF4J interfaces and the
      deployment model will make it easy for developers of other
      logging frameworks to conform to the SLF4J model.
      </p>
     
     <h3>Libraries</h3>

      <p>Authors of widely-distributed components and libraries may
      code against the SLF4J interface in order to avoid imposing an
      logging framework on the developer using the component or library.
      He or she may choose the desired logging framework at deployment time
      by inserting
      the corresponding binding in the classpath, and may change it later
      by replacing the binding jar and restart the application.  This
      approach has proven to be simple and robust.
      </p>
     
        
      <h3>Built-in support in logback</h3>

      <p>The <a href="http://logback.qos.ch/apidocs/ch/qos/logback/classic/Logger.html">
      <code>ch.qos.logback.classic.Logger</code></a> class in
      logback directly implements SLF4J's
      <a href="http://www.slf4j.org/apidocs/org/slf4j/Logger.html">
      <code>org.slf4j.Logger</code></a> interface.
      </p>

      <p>Logback's built-in (a.k.a. native) support for SLF4J means
      that the adapter for does not need to wrap logback objects in
      order to make them conform to SLF4J's <code>Logger</code>
      interface. A logback <code>ch.qos.logback.classic.Logger</code>
      <em>is</em> a <code>org.slf4j.Logger</code>. Thus, using SLF4J
      in conjunction with logback involves strictly zero memory and
      computational overhead.
      </p>

        
      <h3><a name="mdc" href="#mdc">Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC)
      support</a></h3>
      <p>"Mapped Diagnostic Context" is essentially a map maintained by the
      logging framework where the application can provided key-value pairs,
      which can then be inserted by the logging framework in log messages.</p>

      <p>As of version 1.4.1, SLF4J supports MDC, or mapped diagnostic
      context. If the underlying logging framework offers MDC
      functionality, then SLF4J will delegate to the underlying
      framework's MDC. Note that at this time, only log4j and logback
      offer MDC functionality. If the underlying framework does not
      offer MDC, then SLF4J will silently drop MDC information.
      </p>

      <p>Thus, as a SLF4J user, you can take advantage of MDC
      information in the presence of log4j or logback, but without
      forcing these upon your users as dependencies.
      </p>

      <p>As of SLF4J version 1.5.0, SLF4J provides MDC support for
      java.util.logging (JDK 1.4 logging) as well.
      </p>

      <p>For more information on MDC please see the <a
      href="http://logback.qos.ch/manual/mdc.html">chapter on
      MDC</a> in the logback manual.
