
The slf4j-converter aims to 

- if a method declares multipe loggers on the same line, the conversion will not be complete. Example:


  public void someMethod(Log l1, Log l2) {
   ...
  }

  will be converted as 

  public void someMethod(Log l1, Logger l2) {
   ...
  }


  
- the FATAL level is not supported. 

  This is limitation is not deemed serious because there are usually
  very few log statements bearing the FATAL level.
